# Integrating React with Django Multipage Application

## Overview

React and Django are powerful tools for building web applications, each with its own strengths. React excels at creating dynamic, interactive user interfaces, while Django provides a robust backend framework for managing data and serving content. Combining these technologies allows developers to leverage the best of both worlds. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through the process of integrating React into a Django multipage application, covering best practices for both development and production environments.
