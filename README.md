# Integrating React with Django Multipage Application

## Overview

React and Django are powerful tools for building web applications, each with its own strengths. React excels at creating dynamic, interactive user interfaces, while Django provides a robust backend framework for managing data and serving content. Combining these technologies allows developers to leverage the best of both worlds. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through the process of integrating React into a Django multipage application, covering best practices for both development and production environments.




### Create Virtual Environment - MacOS (Optional)

`pip3 install virtualenv`

`python3 -m venv myenv`

`source myenv/bin/activate`



## Step 1: Set Up Django Project

```bash
pip install django
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```
Next, create a Django app within the project:

```
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

Apply Migrations:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Step 2: Set Up React Project


```bash
mkdir frontend
cd frontend
npx create-react-app myreactapp
```

## Step 3: Run the Application

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Start the React development Server:

```bash
cd frontend/myreactapp
npm start
```
